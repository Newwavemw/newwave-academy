# 3. Royalties and Revenue Streams

Musicians in Malawi can earn royalties from different sources, including public performance royalties from the Copyright Society of Malawi (COSOMA) when their music is played on radio, TV, or public performances. They can also receive mechanical royalties from the sale of physical copies and digital downloads.

## International Royalties

Malawian artists can benefit from international royalties through reciprocal agreements between COSOMA and foreign collection societies. This allows them to earn royalties when their music is played or used abroad.
