# 5. Collaborations and Sync Licensing

## Collaborations

Musicians can collaborate with fellow artists or corporate brands, both within Malawi and internationally. These collaborations can result in shared revenue from joint projects, broader exposure, and new fan bases.

## Sync Licensing

Licensing music for use in films, TV shows, advertisements, and video games can provide significant income. Musicians can work with licensing agencies or directly with producers to secure these opportunities.
