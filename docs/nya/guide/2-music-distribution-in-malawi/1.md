# 1. Introduction to Music Distribution

Music distribution is a crucial aspect of a musician's career in Malawi, as it directly impacts their reach and revenue. In a country with a rich and diverse music culture, effective distribution ensures that artists can connect with their audience and earn a living from their craft.

## Importance of Distribution

For Malawian musicians, distribution means getting their music into the hands and ears of fans across the country and beyond. It allows them to share their artistry, convey cultural messages, and sustain their livelihoods. Without effective distribution, talented artists may remain undiscovered.

## Traditional vs. Digital Distribution

Traditionally, Malawian music distribution involved physical copies like CDs and cassettes, which were sold through local distributors like OG ISSA and at live events. In recent years, digital distribution has gained prominence, thanks to platforms like Newwave Malawi, who have advocated for digital distribution. Digital distribution offers wider reach, lower costs, and the potential for global exposure.
