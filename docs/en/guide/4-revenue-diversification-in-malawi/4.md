# 4. Music Education and Workshops

## Teaching Music Lessons

Musicians with proficiency in instruments or vocals can offer private lessons to aspiring musicians. This not only provides income but also contributes to the development of musical talent in Malawi.

## Workshops and Masterclasses

Organising workshops and masterclasses on music theory, song writing, or performance techniques can attract participants who are willing to pay for valuable insights and guidance.
