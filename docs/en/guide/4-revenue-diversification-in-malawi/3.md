# 3. Live Performances and Tours

## Local and International Tours

Musicians can organise tours within Malawi and explore opportunities to perform in neighbouring countries. Live performances at festivals, clubs, and events can generate substantial revenue.

## Booking and Promotion

Successful live performances require effective booking and promotion. Musicians can collaborate with local event organisers and promoters to reach wider audiences and ensure well-attended shows.
