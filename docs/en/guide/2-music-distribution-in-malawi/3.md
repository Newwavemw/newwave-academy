# 3. Physical Distribution in Malawi

While digital distribution is on the rise, physical distribution still plays a significant role in the Malawian music industry.

## Role of Physical Distribution

Physical distribution methods, like selling CDs and radio play, remain important for local artists who perform at live events, cultural festivals, and markets.

## Distribution Channels and Strategies

Musicians in Malawi can work with local record stores referred to as “Soft Copy Distributors”, found in major trading centres across the country, markets, and shops to distribute physical copies of their music. Building relationships with these outlets is essential. Additionally, collaborating with event organisers to sell CDs at live shows can boost physical sales.

Section 29 of the copyright act grants you exclusive rights, including the ability to:

- Reproduce your music.
- Prepare translations or adaptations.
- Distribute copies of your music.
- Perform your music publicly.
- Display your music publicly.
- Communicate your music to the public.

This is why "blank media levies" exist to compensate you for potential unauthorised copying and distribution of your music. Understanding these rights and levies can help you protect and earn from your creative work.
