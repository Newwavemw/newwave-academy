# 2. Digital Distribution in Malawi

Malawian musicians can leverage digital distribution platforms to reach a broader audience both locally and internationally.
Popular Digital Music Platforms:

- Spotify
- Apple Music
- BoomPlay
- YouTube

## Getting Music on these Platforms

Musicians can submit their music to these platforms through aggregator services or directly if they meet the platforms' requirements. Aggregators like DistroKid, CD Baby and TuneCore can help artists distribute their music to various platforms. To upload your music to a digital aggregator and distribute it, you'll typically need the following:

- __High-Quality Audio Files__

Ensure that you have high-quality audio files of your music tracks in a supported format. Most aggregators prefer WAV or FLAC files, but they will convert them to the necessary formats for distribution (e.g., MP3).

- __A GOOD Cover Art__

You'll need cover art for your release. This should be a high-resolution image (usually at least 3000 x 3000 pixels) in JPEG or PNG format. The cover art is what listeners will see when they come across your music on streaming platforms

- __Metadata__

Prepare metadata for each track, including:

1. Song title
2. Artist name
3. Album title (if applicable)
4. Release date
5. Genre
6. Lyrics (optional)
7. ISRC (International Standard Recording Code) if you have one
8. Composer, songwriter, and publisher information

- __Release Information__

Decide on your release date and any specific release strategies, such as pre-orders or pre-saves. Some aggregators also offer the option to set up a specific release time.

- __Account Information__

You'll need to create an account with the digital aggregator if you haven't already. This involves providing your personal and payment information. Some aggregators offer free accounts with revenue-sharing options, while others charge fees.

- __Payment Details__

You'll need to provide your bank account or PayPal information for receiving royalties from your music's sales and streams.

- __Tax Information__

If you're distributing music internationally, you may need to provide tax information, such as a tax ID or W-8BEN form (for non-U.S. residents), to comply with tax regulations in the countries where your music is distributed.

- __Aggregator Fees__

Be prepared to pay any fees associated with using the aggregator's services. These fees may include upfront charges, yearly fees, or a percentage of your earnings.

- __Legal Documentation__

Some aggregators may require you to agree to their terms of service and enter into a distribution agreement. Review these documents carefully before proceeding.

- __YouTube Content ID (If Applicable)__

If you plan to distribute music on YouTube, you may need to provide your music distributor with information about how your music should be registered with YouTube's Content ID system.

- __Revenue-Sharing Models__

Digital platforms often use revenue-sharing models, where artists earn a portion of the revenue generated from streams or downloads. These earnings are typically paid out on a monthly or quarterly basis, helping musicians generate income from their music.
