# 3. COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT

Protecting copyright in Malawi involves identifying and responding to infringement

## Identifying Infringement

Creators should actively monitor the use of their music to identify potential copyright infringement. This may involve tracking the use of their compositions in commercial settings, unauthorised distribution, or illegal downloads.
The law allows for certain uses of copyrighted works without the author's consent or remuneration, such as for educational purposes, reporting on current events, and reproducing works for people with disabilities.

## Legal Remedies

When copyright infringement occurs, creators can take legal action through the Malawian judicial system. Legal remedies may include seeking damages, injunctions to stop the infringing activities, or pursuing criminal charges in severe cases.

## COSOMA's Role

COSOMA plays a crucial role in copyright enforcement in Malawi. They assist creators in protecting their rights and pursuing legal action against infringers.

## Education and Awareness

To combat copyright infringement effectively, COSOMA and other organisations work to educate creators about their rights and the importance of enforcing copyright laws.
