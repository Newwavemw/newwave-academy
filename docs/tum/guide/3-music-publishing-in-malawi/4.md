# 4. Music Publishing Agreements

Music publishing agreements protect the rights of songwriters and composers in Malawi.

## Publishing Agreements

Musicians should be cautious when signing publishing agreements. These contracts specify how revenue will be split between the artist and the publisher. It's essential for artists to understand the terms and seek legal advice if necessary to protect their interests.

## Protecting Rights

Musicians should ensure that their rights as songwriters and composers are protected in publishing agreements. This includes retaining ownership of their compositions and receiving fair compensation for the use of their music.

## Legal Support

In Malawi, artists can seek legal support from organisations like the Malawi Law Society and Newwave Group to ensure that their publishing agreements are fair and in their best interest.
