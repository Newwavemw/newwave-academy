# 1. Music Publishing Basics

Music publishing is a vital aspect of the music industry that needs to be developed more in Malawi, involving the management and monetization of music compositions.

## Significance of Music Publishing

Music publishing is essential for Malawian songwriters and composers as it ensures that they receive royalties when their music is used. This income helps sustain their careers and supports creativity.

## The Role of Music Publishers

Music publishers serve as intermediaries between songwriters and various users of music, including broadcasters, filmmakers, and advertisers. They negotiate licensing deals, collect royalties, and protect the rights of composers.
